## üìñ About
This project solves the classic Dining Philosophers problem using thread synchronization in C. The program simulates philosophers sitting around a table, alternating between eating, thinking, and sleeping, while avoiding deadlock and starvation.


## üìú Rules Implemented

- Philosophers take 2 forks to eat (left and right)
- Forks are shared between adjacent philosophers
- Philosophers die if they don't eat within time_to_die milliseconds
- Simulation stops when a philosopher dies or all complete their meals
- Thread-safe logging with timestamped messages

## üöÄ Features

### Mandatory (Threads & Mutexes)
- Multi-threaded simulation of philosopher behaviors
- Mutex-protected forks to prevent data races
- Configurable timing parameters:
  - Time to eat, sleep, and die
  - Optional meal count limit
- Real-time status logging
- Clean exit on philosopher death or meal completion

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Mandatory:
- POSIX threads (pthread)
- Mutex locks for shared resources
- Microsecond precision timing

### What worked for me

- impose a sleeping time
- assimetric assign of forks
- avoid spin lock for sleeping time

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

```
./philo_bonus <number_of_philos> <time_to_die> <time_to_eat> <time_to_sleep> [meal_limit]
```
